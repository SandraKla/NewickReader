# Paket

This is my first package for a easy Newick-String Reader for R. An example is like ((A,B),C). A and B are level 2 and C level 1. Also you get a nice output :)

1) Download the Zip-File
2) Name it NewickReader and unzip it
3) Install it with: install("NewickReader")
4) Load it into R with library("NewickReader")
